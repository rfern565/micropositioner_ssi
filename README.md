# Micropositioner SSI Control System

This project is part of an ongoing effort to develop a high-precision nanopositioning stage using piezoelectric actuators and a 12-bit absolute SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) encoder. The primary goal is to build a low-cost, high-accuracy control system capable of sub-micron repeatability across X, Y, and Z axes.

### Overview

The micropositioner uses a piezo actuator for each axis, and weâ€™ve implemented a closed-loop PID controller to precisely move the stage to a user-defined position. Position feedback comes from a magnetic encoder that outputs 4096 discrete values over a 2mm range via SSI. The system can be driven by a signal generator or DAC (e.g., MCP4728), depending on the hardware setup.

This repo includes both the firmware running on the Arduino and a Python script for simulating and plotting PID behavior across all three axes.
